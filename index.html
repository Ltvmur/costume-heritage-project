<h3>LLM Prompts and Answers</h3>

<p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> What does the theatrical costume ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù designed by Dario Fo and Miguel Carbonell in 1992 represent? What character is it meant for?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> The costume ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù represents a female royal character, most likely inspired by Queen Isabella of Spain or a generic Renaissance queen. It was created as a theatrical costume sketch and was likely intended for a noble, authoritative female figure on stage. The design reflects the status, power, and elegance associated with aristocratic women of the 16th century.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> What is the historical and symbolic significance of the character ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù in Italian theater or literature?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> "Regina Isabella" evokes the image of royal authority and female power. In Italian theater, such characters are often used to represent the intersection of history and drama. They may symbolize monarchy, tradition, or critique of power structures, especially in political or satirical plays like those by Dario Fo. The symbolism often combines femininity with leadership and influence.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> Was the costume ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù created for a specific theater production or film? If yes, which one?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> The costume was likely created for a theatrical production, possibly connected to a satirical or historical drama by Dario Fo. While specific records of its stage use are limited, the designers' backgrounds in political and avant-garde theater suggest it was intended for a performance emphasizing historical themes or social commentary.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> Describe the typical materials, colors, and style used in 16th-century costumes for female royalty in Italian theater.</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Typical 16th-century theatrical costumes for royal women included materials like velvet, silk, and brocade, often in deep colors such as red, burgundy, or gold. Embroidery in gold or silver thread was common, along with elaborate sleeves, corsets, and floor-length skirts. These costumes were designed to reflect wealth, nobility, and dramatic presence on stage.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> What does a red velvet stage costume typically symbolize in Italian cultural heritage?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> A red velvet costume typically symbolizes power, authority, passion, and prestige. In Italian cultural heritage, red is a color historically linked to both religious and royal figures. On stage, red velvet enhances visual impact and immediately signals that the character is of high importance or status.</p>

<p><em> üü† Where the costume was used üü† </em></p> 
  
<p><strong> üî∂ Zero-shot prompt:</strong> Which theater production or film featured a costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963?
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963, was designed for his play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man). This comedy, written by Dario Fo and Franca Rame, premiered in 1963. The costumes for this production were inspired by the 16th century setting of the play. The drawings, including the "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)," were used for the costume department and actors during the creation of the theatrical pieces. The play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" was later adapted for television by RAI TV in 1977 as part of the series "Il teatro di Dario Fo."
</p>

<p><strong> üî∂ Few-shot prompt:</strong> Example:Design: "Historical armor costume sketch by Danilo Donati (1970)"
Q: In which film was this used?
A: It was used in the film "Fellini Satyricon" (1969).

Now:
Design: "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo (1963)
Q: In which theatre performance or film was the costume used?
A:
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A: The costume was used in the theatre performance "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man), written by Dario Fo and Franca Rame, which premiered in 1963.
</p>

<p><strong> üî∂ Chain-of-thought prompt:</strong> Let's examine the origin of the costume. It is based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963. Dario Fo was an influential Italian playwright and costume designer. Considering the year and his theatrical work, what performance might have featured this costume? Could it have been used in one of his satirical plays or a specific production from that period?
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You are absolutely on the right track! Dario Fo was indeed a master of satirical theater, and his costume designs were an integral part of his productions. The costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963, was almost certainly used in his satirical play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man). Here's why this is the most likely origin:
Year of Creation: The design is from 1963, and "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" premiered in that very year. This direct correlation in timing makes it highly probable.
Dario Fo's Style: Fo was renowned for his political and social satire, often using historical events and figures to comment on contemporary issues. "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" is a prime example of this, offering a comedic and critical look at the "discovery" of America by Christopher Columbus and the role of Queen Isabella. His costumes would have been designed to enhance this satirical tone, perhaps with exaggerated or anachronistic elements.
His Role as Costume Designer: As a true "uomo di teatro" (man of the theater), Dario Fo was involved in all aspects of his productions, including writing, directing, acting, and often, costume and set design. It was common for him to create his own "figurini" (sketches) for the costumes.
Historical Context: The play's setting in the late 15th century (the time of Columbus) would necessitate costumes that evoke that period, even if satirically. Fo's "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili" would have been a direct blueprint for the female characters' attire in this historical-satirical context.
In summary, given the date and Fo's prominent theatrical output in 1963, "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" stands out as the definitive production for which this costume design would have been created.
</p>

<p><strong> üî∂ Instruction-based prompt:</strong> You are a cultural heritage expert. Please identify in which theatrical production or film a costume based on the drawing series "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo (1963) was likely used. Take into account Dario Fo's known theatrical works and his collaborations in the 1960s. If an exact title is unknown, suggest the most plausible performance.
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> As a cultural heritage expert, I can confidently state that the costume based on the drawing series "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo (1963) was almost certainly used in his play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man). Here's a breakdown of the reasoning, considering Dario Fo's theatrical works and collaborations in the 1960s:
Precise Dating: The key piece of information is the creation date of the drawing: 1963. This immediately narrows down the possibilities to productions from that specific year or slightly thereafter.
Dario Fo's 1963 Production: Dario Fo and Franca Rame premiered "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" in 1963. This satirical comedy, which reinterprets the story of Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella, was a significant work in their repertoire.
Fo's Involvement in all Aspects of Production: Dario Fo was not just a playwright; he was a true "uomo di teatro" ‚Äì deeply involved in directing, acting, and often the visual aspects, including costume and set design. It was common for him to create his own "figurini" (sketches) for the costumes used in his plays.
Nature of the Play: "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" is a historical satire, which would naturally require period-inspired costumes. The "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili" (sketches for female stage costumes) would be precisely what was needed for the female characters in such a production.
Lack of Other Contenders: While Fo had other notable works in the 1960s (such as "Archangels Don't Play Pinball" from 1960, or "Mistero Buffo" which evolved over time but became prominent later in the decade), "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" is the most direct and chronologically fitting major theatrical production by Fo and Rame from 1963. There is no known film from 1963 that heavily featured his costume designs in this manner; his filmography shows "Follie d'estate" where he acted as a gangster, which is unlikely to align with these historical costume drawings.
Therefore, given the year of creation of the drawings and the specific theatrical output of Dario Fo and Franca Rame during that period, "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" is the overwhelmingly plausible theatrical production where these costume designs were utilized.</p>

<p><em> üü¢ Period and style of the cosutme üü¢ </em></p> 
<p><strong> üî∑ Zero-shot prompt:</strong> What historical clothing style is represented by a costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Based on the context that the drawing series "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo was created in 1963 for his play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man), the costumes would have represented a 15th to early 16th-century historical clothing style, specifically influenced by the Spanish court and broader European fashion of that period.
Here's why:
Play's Setting: "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" is a satirical comedy that revolves around Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain. The historical events it parodies took place at the very end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century.
Dario Fo's Approach: While Dario Fo was known for his satirical and often anachronistic use of history to comment on contemporary society, his costumes for such plays would still be rooted in the historical period he was depicting. He would draw from actual historical clothing styles to create a recognizable base, which he would then manipulate, exaggerate, or simplify for comedic and political effect.
Specific Characteristics:
Female costumes of this era typically featured layered garments: an undergown (chemise), a fitted kirtle or gown, and often an overgown or robe.
Bodices could be tightly laced, and skirts were full, sometimes gathered or pleated.
Sleeves varied greatly, from fitted to large and elaborate, sometimes with slashes to reveal the lining or undergarment.
Headwear was crucial for women, ranging from simple veils and coifs to more elaborate headdresses like the hennin (though more common in the earlier 15th century) or the gabled hood and later French hoods. Spanish fashion, which would be particularly relevant for Queen Isabella, often featured more structured and formal headwear and elaborate brocades.
Fabrics would typically be rich for courtly figures, such as brocade, velvet, and silk, while commoners would wear wools and linens.
Therefore, the costume based on Dario Fo's 1963 drawing would have satirically or stylistically referenced the clothing of the Late Gothic to Early Renaissance period (circa 1480s-1520s), particularly as seen in Spain.
</p>
<p><strong> üî∑ Few-shot prompt:</strong> Example:
Sketch: "18th century aristocratic dress design by Luchino Visconti"
Q: What style does it represent?
A: Rococo, mid-18th century European fashion.

Now:
Sketch: "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, 1963
Q: What historical style or fashion period does this costume represent?
A:
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A: Late Gothic to Early Renaissance period, specifically the late 15th to early 16th century European fashion, influenced by Spanish court attire.
</p>
<p><strong> üî∑ Chain-of-thought prompt:</strong> Let‚Äôs analyze the style. The costume is based on sketches titled "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo from 1963. Dario Fo often referenced historical styles in his satirical plays. What fashion period or historical clothing style might be reflected in this design? Consider typical theatrical costumes of the time and Fo‚Äôs influences.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963, would reflect the Late Gothic to Early Renaissance period, specifically drawing from late 15th-century to early 16th-century European fashion, with a particular emphasis on Spanish court attire.
Here's the detailed analysis:
Historical Setting of "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe": The play directly lampoons the era of Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain. This places the historical reference squarely in the late 1400s to the early 1500s.
Dario Fo's Theatrical Style: Fo was renowned for his commedia dell'arte influences, satirical approach, and use of historical narratives to critique contemporary society. While his plays often incorporated anachronisms or exaggerated elements for comedic and political effect, the base of his historical costumes would still be recognizable to the audience as belonging to a specific era. He wasn't aiming for absolute historical accuracy, but rather a recognizable historical archetype that could then be subverted.
Typical Female Silhouettes of the Period (Late 15th/Early 16th Century):
Bodices: Often fitted, sometimes with a V-shaped front or square neckline. Lacing could be visible.
Sleeves: Varied, from long and relatively narrow to large, full, and sometimes slashed to reveal elaborate undersleeves or lining. The "bag sleeve" was popular, as were sleeves gathered at the shoulder.
Skirts: Full, often gathered or pleated, and reaching to the floor. They would create a stately, wide silhouette, sometimes supported by petticoats.
Headwear: Essential for married women. This could include elaborate headdresses, veils, coifs, or structured hoods (like the gabled hood or various Spanish forms).
Fabrics: For courtly figures like Queen Isabella, rich fabrics such as brocade, velvet, and silk would be depicted, often with intricate patterns and embellishments.
Fo's Satirical Adaptation: While the base style would be late 15th/early 16th century, Fo's satirical intent would likely lead to:
Exaggeration: Elements like sleeves, headwear, or overall volume might be exaggerated for comedic effect.
Simplification: Details might be simplified or stylized to serve the theatrical narrative rather than strict historical recreation.
Theatricality: The costumes would be designed for stage presence, perhaps with bold colors or clear lines to be visible from a distance.
Possible Anachronism (subtle): While maintaining the core historical feel, Fo might introduce subtle modern touches or anachronistic details that underscore his satirical commentary, though this would be less about a distinct "1960s fashion influence" on the historical style and more about his directorial choices.
In essence, the costume would represent a theatrical interpretation of Late Gothic/Early Renaissance courtly attire, specifically for women, with Dario Fo's characteristic satirical and visually impactful design flair.
</p>
<p><strong> üî∑ Instruction-based prompt:</strong> You are a historian of theatrical costume design. Please analyze the clothing style of a costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo (1963). Indicate the historical era or stylistic movement it reflects (e.g., Renaissance, Baroque, 19th-century bourgeoisie, etc.). If the design is theatrical reinterpretation of a historical style, please mention that as well.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> As a historian of theatrical costume design, I can analyze the clothing style of a costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo (1963) as a theatrical reinterpretation of the Late Gothic to Early Renaissance period, specifically the late 15th to early 16th century European fashion, with a distinct emphasis on Spanish court attire.
Here's a breakdown of the analysis:
Primary Historical Era: The core inspiration for the costume clearly originates from the Late 15th Century to Early 16th Century. This aligns precisely with the historical setting of Dario Fo's play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (1963), which satirizes the figures of Queen Isabella of Castile and Christopher Columbus. The fashion of this period, particularly in the Spanish court, was characterized by distinct silhouettes for women.
Key Characteristics of the Referenced Historical Style:
Silhouette: Women's fashion moved towards a more structured and imposing silhouette. Gowns often featured fitted bodices, sometimes with a pointed waistline, and very full, voluminous skirts.
Necklines: Square or wide, rounded necklines were common, often revealing the chemise beneath.
Sleeves: Varied widely, from close-fitting to extremely wide and sometimes slashed to reveal contrasting linings or undersleeves. The "bag sleeve" or "hanging sleeve" with an opening to allow the arm to pass through was also prevalent.
Headwear: Elaborate and often structured headwear was crucial, such as the gabled hood in England, or various forms of Spanish headdresses that could be stiffened and draped with veils, reflecting status and modesty.
Fabrics: Rich brocades, velvets, and silks were used for courtly dress, often in deep, vibrant colors, reflecting the opulence of the era.
Theatrical Reinterpretation by Dario Fo: It is crucial to emphasize that this is a theatrical reinterpretation rather than a precise historical reconstruction. Dario Fo, as a master of commedia dell'arte and political satire, would not have aimed for museum-level historical accuracy. Instead, his designs would have served several functions:
Immediate Recognition: The costume would need to be immediately recognizable by the audience as belonging to the specific historical period being satirized (i.e., Queen Isabella's era).
Exaggeration for Satire: Fo frequently employed exaggeration, caricature, and simplification in his costume designs to enhance comedic effect and underscore his critical commentary. Elements like sleeves, headwear, or the overall volume of the skirt might be slightly overblown or stylized for dramatic impact and comedic timing.
Functionality for Performance: The costumes needed to allow for the dynamic, often physical, performances characteristic of Fo's plays. This might involve practical considerations that diverge from strict historical accuracy, such as ease of movement or quick changes.
Aesthetic Cohesion with Set Design: The costume would also integrate with the overall visual aesthetic of the stage design, contributing to a cohesive theatrical world that was both historically evocative and boldly satirical.
In summary, the costume based on Dario Fo's 1963 "figurini" represents a theatrical reinterpretation of Late 15th-Early 16th Century European (specifically Spanish) court fashion, designed to visually anchor his satirical narrative while allowing for the expressive and often exaggerated performance style of his theatre.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This project demonstrates how knowledge graphs and language models can work together to enrich cultural heritage data. The costume is not only a visual artifact, but also a narrative element linked to Italian theater and political satire.By combining structured data from ArCo with insights generated through prompting large language models, we were able to uncover its theatrical origin, stylistic influences, and cultural significance.
In particular, this case highlights how Dario Fo‚Äôs figurini are not merely design sketches, but entry points into broader stories of performance, history, and ideology. The costume becomes a lens through which we can view not only a play, but an entire period of social commentary and artistic experimentation.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Why is Arlecchino‚Äôs costume traditionally multicolored and made of diamonds?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The multicolored diamond pattern reflects Arlecchino‚Äôs lively and chaotic persona. Historically, it symbolized poverty and improvisation, as servants like Arlecchino were thought to wear patched clothing made from fabric scraps. Over time, it became a defining visual code for his comedic and cunning role.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> How does the costume‚Äôs color palette affect the perception of the character?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The bright and contrasting colors emphasize Arlecchino‚Äôs mischievous energy and help distinguish him visually as a comic figure. The vivid palette enhances his role as a dynamic trickster and draws audience attention during physical performances.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> What does the use of a mask represent in Arlecchino‚Äôs character?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The mask reinforces Arlecchino‚Äôs identity as an archetype rather than an individual. It supports exaggerated expression through movement and gesture while highlighting his anonymity, subversiveness, and theatrical function as a clever servant.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> What role do the hat and other accessories play in his visual identity?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Accessories like a soft cap with a feather contribute to Arlecchino‚Äôs playful, agile image. These elements support his clown-like appearance while also adding stylized cues that reflect his social role and physical humor.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> How has the image of Arlecchino evolved from the 17th to the 20th century?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Arlecchino originated as a comic servant in 17th-century commedia dell‚Äôarte, known for slapstick humor and acrobatics. In the 20th century, especially through Dario Fo, he evolved into a politically charged figure ‚Äî a vehicle for satire and critique of power structures, while retaining his core attributes of wit and agility.</p>

<h1 id="anastasiia">Anastasiia ‚Äì La Fama Costume Analysis</h1>

<h2>Topic</h2>
<p>
My contribution focused on the theatrical costume <strong>‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù</strong>, represented as a female winged figure, carrying an eagle and a caduceus, with a red drape decorated with laurel wreaths and a corset featuring the figure of Fame. This costume is cataloged in the ArCo Knowledge Graph as a <em>Historic or Artistic Property</em>, and was used as a stage design drawing.
</p>
<p>
The allegorical figure of Fame (La Fama) is deeply rooted in classical and Renaissance iconography and remains a recurring character in Italian visual and performing arts. The drawing, likely part of a theatrical set or costume collection, captures symbolic elements such as victory (laurel), power (eagle), and communication (caduceus), which are strongly associated with both theater and political representation.
</p>
<img src="la-fama.jpg" alt="La Fama Costume" width="400">
<h2>SPARQL Analysis</h2>
<p>
To explore the metadata associated with the ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù costume, I queried the ArCo SPARQL endpoint using the resource ID <a href="https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview-arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0100408590-23">0100408590-23</a>.
</p>
<p>
The object is defined as a <strong>HistoricOrArtisticProperty</strong>, with the cultural property type <strong>SculptureDrawing</strong>. It includes a short descriptive label, title, inventory number, and cultural context. However, the metadata lacks explicit information about <strong>the symbolic meaning</strong> of the elements depicted and the <strong>artistic role of the costume on stage</strong>.
</p>
<p>
This gap provides a perfect opportunity for enrichment using LLMs to generate contextual knowledge that could enhance the understanding of the costume‚Äôs cultural and artistic value.
</p>

<h2>LLM Prompts and Answers</h2>

<p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> What is the symbolic meaning of the female figure depicted in the 1908 costume drawing ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù? How is this figure of Fame represented in Italian cultural history?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The figure ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù symbolizes the spread of renown, honor, and cultural immortality. In Italian tradition, she is often portrayed as a winged female messenger, tied to classical mythology. By the early 20th century, ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù was used in theater and civic iconography to evoke prestige, intellectual achievement, and the celebration of artistic legacy.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> The drawing includes an eagle, laurel wreaths, and a caduceus. What do these symbols represent in Italian theatrical or artistic contexts?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The eagle represents authority and victory; the laurel wreaths signify honor and poetic excellence; the caduceus represents eloquence and communication. Together, they frame ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù as a symbol of cultural greatness.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> How were allegorical female figures like ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù used in early 20th-century Italian stage productions, especially in scenographic or costume elements?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> They were key elements in patriotic performances and modern reinterpretations of classical themes, used to embody abstract ideals and convey messages through visual symbolism.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> Why would the artist use ivory paper, ink, and watercolor for a costume drawing like this? What effect do these materials produce for theater design?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> These materials allow for precise lines and delicate tonal washes, helping designers visualize how the costume will appear under stage lighting and in motion.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> How does the visual language of the ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù costume drawing reflect ideas of cultural prestige, national identity, or artistic ideals in Italy at the beginning of the 20th century?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The costume expresses national pride through classical references and symbols of artistic excellence. It reflects Italy‚Äôs cultural identity rooted in grandeur, eloquence, and visual beauty.</p>

<h2>Enrichment</h2>
<p>
Based on the insights provided by language models, I created RDF triples to enrich the knowledge graph entry for the theatrical costume drawing ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù (ArCo ID: 0100408590-23). These triples capture symbolic, cultural, and artistic information that was not present in the original metadata.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This project explored the theatrical costume drawing ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù by enriching its ArCo record with symbolic, historical, and artistic interpretations that were not included in the original metadata. Thanks to the use of language models, it was possible to better understand the meaning of key visual elements like the eagle, laurel wreaths, and caduceus, and to place the costume in the broader context of Italian stage culture. The enrichment shows how even a single costume sketch can reveal important aspects of national identity, visual storytelling, and early 20th-century performance practices.

  <h2 id="danil">Danil - Costume of the "Second Accuser" in Dario Fo's <em>Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe</em> </h2>

  <h3>Topic</h3>
  <p>My contribution focused on analyzing the costume of the "Second Accuser" from Dario Fo's 1992 Valencian production of <em>Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe</em>. This study combines SPARQL queries of cultural heritage databases with Large Language Model (LLM) inferences to reconstruct the costume's design, materials, and historical influences.</p>

  <h3>SPARQL Analysis</h3>
  <p>Using SPARQL, I queried the ArCo endpoint to explore the metadata for theatrical costumes linked to Dario Fo:</p>
  
  <pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT ?cp

  ?cp a arco:HistoricOrArtisticProperty ; 
      rdfs:label ?l .
  FILTER(REGEX(?l, "vestito|teatro|costume|Fo", "i"))
}

  <p>The retrieved information includes general records on Fo's theatrical costumes but no direct match for the 1992 Valencia production. Key gaps identified:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Missing performance link</strong> to the 1992 Valencia production</li>
    <li><strong>No details</strong> on fabric, color, or construction</li>
    <li><strong>Unclear historical/artistic parody references</strong></li>

  <p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Which Dario Fo play featured a 'Second Accuser' character in a 1992 Valencia production, and what was the costume's symbolic role?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The play is <em>Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe</em> (1992, Valencia), a satire of Columbus and the Spanish court. The 'Second Accuser' costume likely parodied Inquisition officials or corrupt nobles‚Äîexaggerated with tattered luxury (e.g., burlap dyed red/gold) to critique power and dogma.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Describe plausible materials, colors, and accessories for this costume, considering Fo's aesthetic.<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Materials: Cheap fabrics (burlap, linen) to mock opulence, with visible stitching. Colors: Red (blood/authority) and gold (greed), deliberately garish. Accessories: Oversized rosary, giant quill, or a <em>commedia</em>-style hooked nose to emphasize hypocrisy.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> What historical/clothing styles did Fo distort for this character?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Fo blended:
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Inquisition robes</strong> (elongated sleeves, black/red)</li>
    <li><strong>Commedia's Il Dottore</strong> (scholarly pomp via oversized hat)</li>
    <li><strong>Renaissance doublets</strong> (distorted with asymmetrical patterns)</li>
  </ol>
  This fusion underscored the absurdity of dogmatic authority.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project demonstrates how knowledge graphs and language models can work together to enrich cultural heritage data. The "Second Accuser" costume is not merely a theatrical artifact, but a narrative device tied to Dario Fo's political satire and the tradition of <em>commedia dell'arte</em>. By combining structured data from ArCo with insights generated through prompting large language models, we uncovered its role in <em>Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe</em> (1992, Valencia), its materials (burlap, linen, exaggerated accessories), and its stylistic parody of Inquisition robes and Renaissance power dress.</p>
    <p>The costume becomes a lens through which we can view Fo's critique of dogma and colonialism‚Äîblending historical reference with grotesque theater. This case also underscores the challenges of documenting ephemeral stage designs and the value of LLMs in reconstructing lost context.</p>
