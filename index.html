<h3>SPARQL Analysis</h3>
<p>
Using SPARQL, I explored the ArCo endpoint and retrieved the properties of the object 
<a href="https://w3id.org/arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0500704575" target="_blank">0500704575</a>. I found that the object already includes metadata such as title, authorship, and description. However, it lacked symbolic, material, and contextual information.
</p>

<h3>LLM Prompts and Answers</h3>

<p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> What does the theatrical costume ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù designed by Dario Fo and Miguel Carbonell in 1992 represent? What character is it meant for?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> The costume ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù represents a female royal character, most likely inspired by Queen Isabella of Spain or a generic Renaissance queen. It was created as a theatrical costume sketch and was likely intended for a noble, authoritative female figure on stage. The design reflects the status, power, and elegance associated with aristocratic women of the 16th century.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> What is the historical and symbolic significance of the character ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù in Italian theater or literature?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> "Regina Isabella" evokes the image of royal authority and female power. In Italian theater, such characters are often used to represent the intersection of history and drama. They may symbolize monarchy, tradition, or critique of power structures, especially in political or satirical plays like those by Dario Fo. The symbolism often combines femininity with leadership and influence.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> Was the costume ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù created for a specific theater production or film? If yes, which one?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> The costume was likely created for a theatrical production, possibly connected to a satirical or historical drama by Dario Fo. While specific records of its stage use are limited, the designers' backgrounds in political and avant-garde theater suggest it was intended for a performance emphasizing historical themes or social commentary.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> Describe the typical materials, colors, and style used in 16th-century costumes for female royalty in Italian theater.</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Typical 16th-century theatrical costumes for royal women included materials like velvet, silk, and brocade, often in deep colors such as red, burgundy, or gold. Embroidery in gold or silver thread was common, along with elaborate sleeves, corsets, and floor-length skirts. These costumes were designed to reflect wealth, nobility, and dramatic presence on stage.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> What does a red velvet stage costume typically symbolize in Italian cultural heritage?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> A red velvet costume typically symbolizes power, authority, passion, and prestige. In Italian cultural heritage, red is a color historically linked to both religious and royal figures. On stage, red velvet enhances visual impact and immediately signals that the character is of high importance or status.</p>

<h2>Mariam - Costume by Dario Fo (1963)</h2>

<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>
My contribution is focused on analyzing the theatrical costume created in 1963 by <strong>Dario Fo</strong>.
</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ltvmur/costume-heritage-project/main/costume_0500704524.jpeg" alt="Costume by Dario Fo (1963)" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px 0;">

<h2>SPARQL Analysis</h2>
<p>Using SPARQL, I queried the ArCo endpoint to explore the metadata for object 0500704524. The retrieved information includes:</p>
<p>* Title: Costume teatrale
<ul><li><strong>Title:<strong> Costume teatrale<li>
  <li><strong>Type:<strong> Theatrical costume<li>
  <li><strong>Dimensions:<strong> Height 150 cm, Width 60 cm<li>
  <li><strong>Materials:<strong> Fabric, wood, metal<li>
  <li><strong>Techniques:<strong> Sewing, wood carving, metalworking<li>
  <li><strong>Color:<strong> Red, gold, black<li><ul>
<p>However, ArCo lacks contextual and semantic enrichment that could connect this object to broader cultural knowledge. Specifically, the following key aspects are missing:<p>
<p>* üé¨ Which theatrical performance or film was this costume used in?
* üëó What historical period or clothing style does it represent?<p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT ?cp 
WHERE {
?cp a arco:HistoricOrArtisticProperty ; 
rdfs:label ?l .
FILTER(REGEX(?l, "vestito|teatro|cinema|costume|disegno", "i"))
}
LIMIT 50
  </pre>

<p>To address these gaps, I used Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer missing connections and generate RDF triples that enrich the knowledge graph with contextual and stylistic information.
<p>
  
  <h2>RDF Triples</h2>
  <p>I created RDF triples describing the cultural and stylistic context of the costume:</p>
  <p><a href="https://marikvel.github.io/costume-heritage-project/rdf/costume_0500704524.ttl" target="_blank">
    View RDF data (.ttl)</a></p>

  <h2>Language Model Results</h2>
  <p>I used ChatGPT, Gemini, and LlaMa 2 Family to analyze this costume. All three models agreed that the costume was designed for the play <em>Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe</em> and reflected a stylized version of late 15th to early 16th-century Spanish court fashion.</p>

  

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This project demonstrates how knowledge graphs and language models can work together to enrich cultural heritage data. The costume is not only a visual artifact, but also a narrative element linked to Italian theater and political satire.</p>

  <h2>Arina ‚Äì Arlecchino '600 Costume Analysis</h2>

  <h3>Topic</h3>
  <p>My contribution focused on analyzing the theatrical costume ‚ÄúArlecchino '600‚Äù, a costume sketch attributed to Dario Fo, Nobel laureate in literature. This costume is cataloged in the ArCo Knowledge Graph as a Historic or Artistic Property and represents the traditional character Arlecchino from Commedia dell‚ÄôArte.</p>

  <h3>SPARQL Analysis</h3>
  <p>Using SPARQL, I queried the ArCo endpoint to explore the metadata for object 0500704151. The retrieved information includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Title:</strong> Arlecchino '600, figurino per costume di scena, maschile</li>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> Dario Fo</li>
    <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Carta (paper), inchiostro (ink)</li>
    <li><strong>Description:</strong> A costume sketch for the character Arlecchino, rooted in the 17th-century tradition of Italian theatre.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, additional symbolic, contextual, and linkage data (e.g., performance, theatrical company) were missing and could be enriched using LLMs and external sources.</p>

  <h3>LLM Prompts and Answers</h3>
  <p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Why is Arlecchino‚Äôs costume traditionally multicolored and made of diamonds?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The multicolored diamond pattern reflects Arlecchino‚Äôs lively and chaotic persona. Historically, it symbolized poverty and improvisation, as servants like Arlecchino were thought to wear patched clothing made from fabric scraps. Over time, it became a defining visual code for his comedic and cunning role.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> How does the costume‚Äôs color palette affect the perception of the character?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The bright and contrasting colors emphasize Arlecchino‚Äôs mischievous energy and help distinguish him visually as a comic figure. The vivid palette enhances his role as a dynamic trickster and draws audience attention during physical performances.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> What does the use of a mask represent in Arlecchino‚Äôs character?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The mask reinforces Arlecchino‚Äôs identity as an archetype rather than an individual. It supports exaggerated expression through movement and gesture while highlighting his anonymity, subversiveness, and theatrical function as a clever servant.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> What role do the hat and other accessories play in his visual identity?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Accessories like a soft cap with a feather contribute to Arlecchino‚Äôs playful, agile image. These elements support his clown-like appearance while also adding stylized cues that reflect his social role and physical humor.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> How has the image of Arlecchino evolved from the 17th to the 20th century?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Arlecchino originated as a comic servant in 17th-century commedia dell‚Äôarte, known for slapstick humor and acrobatics. In the 20th century, especially through Dario Fo, he evolved into a politically charged figure ‚Äî a vehicle for satire and critique of power structures, while retaining his core attributes of wit and agility.</p>

<h1> Anastasiia ‚Äì La Fama Costume Analysis</h1>

<h2>Topic</h2>
<p>
My contribution focused on the theatrical costume <strong>‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù</strong>, represented as a female winged figure, carrying an eagle and a caduceus, with a red drape decorated with laurel wreaths and a corset featuring the figure of Fame. This costume is cataloged in the ArCo Knowledge Graph as a <em>Historic or Artistic Property</em>, and was used as a stage design drawing.
</p>
<p>
The allegorical figure of Fame (La Fama) is deeply rooted in classical and Renaissance iconography and remains a recurring character in Italian visual and performing arts. The drawing, likely part of a theatrical set or costume collection, captures symbolic elements such as victory (laurel), power (eagle), and communication (caduceus), which are strongly associated with both theater and political representation.
</p>
<img src="la-fama.jpg" alt="La Fama Costume" width="400">
<h2>SPARQL Analysis</h2>
<p>
To explore the metadata associated with the ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù costume, I queried the ArCo SPARQL endpoint using the resource ID <a href="https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview-arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0100408590-23">0100408590-23</a>.
</p>
<p>
The object is defined as a <strong>HistoricOrArtisticProperty</strong>, with the cultural property type <strong>SculptureDrawing</strong>. It includes a short descriptive label, title, inventory number, and cultural context. However, the metadata lacks explicit information about <strong>the symbolic meaning</strong> of the elements depicted and the <strong>artistic role of the costume on stage</strong>.
</p>
<p>
This gap provides a perfect opportunity for enrichment using LLMs to generate contextual knowledge that could enhance the understanding of the costume‚Äôs cultural and artistic value.
</p>

<h2>LLM Prompts and Answers</h2>

<p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> What is the symbolic meaning of the female figure depicted in the 1908 costume drawing ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù? How is this figure of Fame represented in Italian cultural history?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The figure ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù symbolizes the spread of renown, honor, and cultural immortality. In Italian tradition, she is often portrayed as a winged female messenger, tied to classical mythology. By the early 20th century, ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù was used in theater and civic iconography to evoke prestige, intellectual achievement, and the celebration of artistic legacy.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> The drawing includes an eagle, laurel wreaths, and a caduceus. What do these symbols represent in Italian theatrical or artistic contexts?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The eagle represents authority and victory; the laurel wreaths signify honor and poetic excellence; the caduceus represents eloquence and communication. Together, they frame ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù as a symbol of cultural greatness.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> How were allegorical female figures like ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù used in early 20th-century Italian stage productions, especially in scenographic or costume elements?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> They were key elements in patriotic performances and modern reinterpretations of classical themes, used to embody abstract ideals and convey messages through visual symbolism.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> Why would the artist use ivory paper, ink, and watercolor for a costume drawing like this? What effect do these materials produce for theater design?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> These materials allow for precise lines and delicate tonal washes, helping designers visualize how the costume will appear under stage lighting and in motion.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> How does the visual language of the ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù costume drawing reflect ideas of cultural prestige, national identity, or artistic ideals in Italy at the beginning of the 20th century?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The costume expresses national pride through classical references and symbols of artistic excellence. It reflects Italy‚Äôs cultural identity rooted in grandeur, eloquence, and visual beauty.</p>

<h2>Enrichment</h2>
<p>
Based on the insights provided by language models, I created RDF triples to enrich the knowledge graph entry for the theatrical costume drawing ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù (ArCo ID: 0100408590-23). These triples capture symbolic, cultural, and artistic information that was not present in the original metadata.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This project explored the theatrical costume drawing ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù by enriching its ArCo record with symbolic, historical, and artistic interpretations that were not included in the original metadata. Thanks to the use of language models, it was possible to better understand the meaning of key visual elements like the eagle, laurel wreaths, and caduceus, and to place the costume in the broader context of Italian stage culture. The enrichment shows how even a single costume sketch can reveal important aspects of national identity, visual storytelling, and early 20th-century performance practices.
