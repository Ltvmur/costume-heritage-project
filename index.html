    <h3>SPARQL Analysis</h3>
    <p>Using SPARQL, I explored the ArCo endpoint and retrieved the properties of the object 
      <a href="https://w3id.org/arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0500704575" target="_blank">0500704575</a>. I found that the object already includes metadata such as title, authorship, and description. However, it lacked symbolic, material, and contextual information.
    </p>
 <h3>LLM Prompting Techniques</h3>

    <h4>1. Zero-shot Prompt</h4>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What does the theatrical costume ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù represent in terms of cultural or symbolic meaning?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It represents royal authority, feminine power, and Renaissance nobility, reflecting the image of a queen from the 16th century.</p>

    <h4>2. Few-shot Prompt</h4>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
    <p>Example 1: Napoleon Bonaparte ‚Äî Symbolizes power and nationalism.<br>
    Example 2: Cleopatra ‚Äî Represents feminine authority and exoticism.<br>
    Now describe ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù.</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Regina Isabella symbolizes dignity, regal presence, and traditional Italian theatrical depictions of female power and historical prestige.</p>

    <h4>3. Chain-of-thought Prompt</h4>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>What historical context does the name ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù refer to?</li>
      <li>What do the materials ‚Äî red velvet and gold embroidery ‚Äî traditionally symbolize?</li>
      <li>How are queens typically portrayed in Italian theater and cultural heritage?</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Based on this reasoning, what does the costume most likely represent?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The name refers to a Renaissance queen, evoking images of female monarchy and historical authority. Red velvet and gold embroidery symbolize luxury, power, and theatrical grandeur. Queens in Italian culture are often portrayed as dignified, commanding, and elegant. Therefore, the costume most likely represents royal status, feminine strength, and the cultural ideal of noble womanhood on stage.</p>

<p><strong>üî∂ Chain-of-thought prompt:</strong> Let's examine the origin of the costume step-by-step.

Considering the year and his theatrical work, what performance might have featured this costume? Could it have been used in one of his satirical plays or a specific production from that period? Explain how you came up with answers step-by-step.</p>

      <td>
        Step 1: Identify Dario Fo‚Äôs role and activities around 1963<br>
        Dario Fo was a renowned Italian playwright, actor, director, and costume designer. By the early 1960s, he had already gained recognition for his satirical and politically charged theater. He often worked with his wife, Franca Rame, and used comedy, farce, and medieval theatrical traditions to critique society and politics.<br><br>
        Step 2: Look into Dario Fo‚Äôs notable works around 1963<br>
        In the early 1960s, Fo produced several plays. Some important ones include:<br>
        ‚Äì ‚ÄúMistero Buffo‚Äù (1969) ‚Äî This is a bit later, so unlikely for 1963.<br>
        ‚Äì ‚ÄúMorte accidentale di un anarchico‚Äù (1970) ‚Äî Also later.<br>
        Around 1963 specifically, Fo was active in smaller productions and developing his style. He might have been working on satirical or politically themed plays involving medieval forms and commedia dell‚Äôarte.<br><br>
        Step 3: Consider the style and function of the costume<br>
        The title "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili" means "sketches for stage costumes, female". Dario Fo‚Äôs female characters often represented strong, symbolic, or comic figures‚Äîsometimes peasants, saints, or caricatures of political figures. His costumes usually reflected historical or folk styles, sometimes exaggerated for satirical effect.<br><br>
        Step 4: Linking costume to a play or type of production<br>
        Given the year 1963, the costume was likely designed for a satirical play or a production influenced by medieval/folk theatre. One candidate is Fo‚Äôs early satirical works or short plays performed by his troupe. It could also be a costume for Franca Rame, who frequently played strong female roles in his plays. Considering Fo‚Äôs penchant for historical or allegorical subjects, the costume might reflect a character from a medieval fable, a peasant woman, or a symbolic figure.<br><br>
        Step 5: Conclusion ‚Äî most likely scenario<br>
        The costume from 1963 was probably designed for one of Dario Fo‚Äôs early satirical plays or staged readings, performed by his theater company. Since there is no specific major play explicitly documented in that exact year with detailed costume records, the best guess is that it was for a female character in a politically satirical, socially critical production, typical of Fo‚Äôs style. It may also have been preparatory work for later, more famous plays like Mistero Buffo, where such medieval-inspired costumes became iconic.<br><br>
        Summary:<br>
        Dario Fo‚Äôs 1963 female costume sketch was likely for an early satirical or folk-inspired play. It fits the style of his politically charged, humorous theater featuring symbolic female roles. Exact production is unclear, but probably part of his evolving theatrical experiments in the early 60s before Mistero Buffo.

<p><strong>üî∑ Zero-shot prompt:</strong> What historical clothing style is represented by a costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963?</p>

      <td>
        The costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963, likely represents a Renaissance-inspired theatrical style, drawing heavily from commedia dell‚Äôarte and late medieval to early modern European fashion.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Key Characteristics of the Historical Style:</strong><br>
        ‚Äì <em>Exaggerated Silhouettes:</em> Fo often used voluminous skirts, cinched waists, and puffed sleeves to reflect Renaissance and Baroque fashion in a satirical, exaggerated manner.<br>
        ‚Äì <em>Decorative Elements:</em> Ornate patterns, ruffles, and contrasting fabrics were common‚Äîechoing courtly styles from the 16th and 17th centuries, stylized for stage impact.<br>
        ‚Äì <em>Commedia dell‚ÄôArte Influence:</em> As a central influence on Fo‚Äôs work, this tradition brought in archetypal costumes with symbolic colors and stylized shapes‚Äîespecially for female stock characters like Colombina or the Innamorata.<br>
        ‚Äì <em>Carnivalesque Aesthetic:</em> True to Fo‚Äôs theatrical language, the costumes were often playful and distorted versions of historical garments, used to highlight satire, absurdity, or social critique.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
        The historical clothing style represented in the 1963 costume design by Dario Fo is best described as a stylized Renaissance/commedia dell‚Äôarte hybrid, referencing late 15th to early 17th-century European fashion, adapted for theatrical and satirical purposes.

        Based on the context that the drawing series "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo was created in 1963 for his play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man), the costumes would have represented a 15th to early 16th-century historical clothing style, specifically influenced by the Spanish court and broader European fashion of that period.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Play's Setting:</strong> This comedy revolves around Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella. The historical events it parodies took place at the very end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century.<br><br>
        <strong>Dario Fo's Approach:</strong> While known for satirical and often anachronistic use of history to comment on contemporary society, Fo would draw from actual historical clothing styles to create a recognizable base, which he would then manipulate, exaggerate, or simplify for comedic and political effect.

        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Matches 14th to early 16th century Italian dress.<br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Conclusion ‚Äî The sketches most likely reflect medieval/early Renaissance Italian peasant clothing stylized for satire and theater.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This project demonstrates how knowledge graphs and language models can work together to enrich cultural heritage data. The costume is not only a visual artifact, but also a narrative element linked to Italian theater and political satire. By combining structured data from ArCo with insights generated through prompting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a>, we were able to uncover its theatrical origin, stylistic influences, and cultural significance.</p>
<p>In particular, this case highlights how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_Fo" target="_blank">Dario Fo's</a> figurini are not merely design sketches, but entry points into broader stories of performance, history, and ideology. The costume becomes a lens through which we can view not only a play, but an entire period of social commentary and artistic experimentation.</p>

  <h2>Arina ‚Äì Arlecchino '600 Costume Analysis</h2>

  <h3>Topic</h3>
  <p>My contribution focused on analyzing the theatrical costume 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin" target="_blank">‚ÄúArlecchino '600‚Äù</a>, 
  a costume sketch attributed to Dario Fo, Nobel laureate in literature. This costume is cataloged in the ArCo Knowledge Graph as a Historic or Artistic Property and represents the traditional character Arlecchino from 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte" target="_blank">Commedia dell‚ÄôArte</a>.</p>

  <h3>SPARQL Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    Using SPARQL, I queried the ArCo endpoint to explore the metadata for object

      0500704151
    </a>.
    The retrieved information includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Title:</strong> Arlecchino '600, figurino per costume di scena, maschile</li>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> Dario Fo</li>
    <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Carta (paper), inchiostro (ink)</li>
    <li><strong>Description:</strong> A costume sketch for the character Arlecchino, rooted in the 17th-century tradition of Italian theatre.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    However, symbolic, contextual, and performance-related metadata (such as theatrical company, role in performance, or cultural interpretation) were missing. These gaps were addressed using LLMs and external research tools.
  </p>

  <h3>LLM Prompts and Responses</h3>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This project explored the cultural and theatrical significance of the <em>Arlecchino '600</em> costume, leveraging the ArCo Knowledge Graph and SPARQL to retrieve structured metadata.
      By focusing on a historically rich and symbolically layered character like Arlecchino, the analysis highlighted the need for deeper contextualization and interlinking of cultural data.
      The work demonstrates how knowledge graphs, when combined with external research and semantic enrichment, can preserve and promote Italy‚Äôs rich theatrical heritage in the digital age.

  <h2>Anastasiia ‚Äì La Fama Costume Analysis</h2>

  <h3>Topic</h3>
  <p>
    My contribution focused on the theatrical costume <em>La Fama</em>, represented as a winged female figure carrying an eagle and a caduceus, with a red drape decorated with laurel wreaths.
    This costume is cataloged in the ArCo Knowledge Graph as a Historic or Artistic Property and was used as a stage design drawing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The allegorical figure of Fame is deeply rooted in classical and Renaissance iconography and remains a recurring character in Italian visual and performing arts.
    The drawing captures symbolic elements such as <strong>victory</strong> (laurel), <strong>power</strong> (eagle), and <strong>communication</strong> (caduceus).
  </p>
  <img src="la-fama.jpg" alt="La Fama Costume Drawing" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px 0;" />

  <h3>SPARQL Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    I queried the ArCo SPARQL endpoint using the resource ID <code>0100408590‚Äì23</code>. The costume is described in ArCo as a <strong>HistoricOrArtisticProperty</strong>,
    with the type <strong>SculptureDrawing</strong>, and provides metadata such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Author: Luigi Sapelli (1908)</li>
    <li>Material: ink and watercolor on ivory paper</li>
    <li>Title and classification metadata</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    However, symbolic and cultural elements were missing from the original metadata. These were added through LLM-based enrichment.
  </p>

  <h3>LLM Prompts and Answers</h3>
  <p>
    I used GPT-4, Gemini, and DeepSeek to interpret the symbols of the costume, comparing responses across three prompting strategies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Zero-shot:</strong> Interpreting eagle, caduceus, and laurel without prior context</li>
    <li><strong>Few-shot:</strong> Using analogy examples to guide symbol interpretation</li>
    <li><strong>Chain-of-Thought:</strong> Step-by-step breakdown of symbolic elements</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>RDF Enrichment</h3>
  <p>I created RDF triples based on the symbolic analysis:</p>

</code></pre>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    The <em>La Fama</em> costume represents a fusion of classical symbolism and early 20th-century theatrical design. Through SPARQL queries and LLM analysis,
    I revealed a richer cultural interpretation beyond the original catalog metadata. The RDF enrichment ensures that future users and machines
    can grasp the deeper meanings embedded in the artwork.

  <h3>SPARQL Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    Using SPARQL, I queried the ArCo endpoint for theatrical costumes linked to Dario Fo. No direct match for the 1992 Valencia production was found.
    The search revealed missing details such as fabric, color, performance linkage, and symbolic interpretation.
  </p>

  <h3>LLM Prompts and Interpretation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prompt:</strong> What costume was used for the ‚ÄúSecond Accuser‚Äù in Fo's 1992 production?</li>
    <li><strong>Answer:</strong> Burlap and linen robe, garish black/gold coloring, parody of Inquisition authority.</li>
    <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Costume combines <em>commedia dell‚Äôarte</em> with religious satire, using oversized rosary, crooked nose, and corrupted symbols.</li>
