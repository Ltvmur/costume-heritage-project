<h1>Italian Cinema and Cultural Heritage: Costumes as Cultural Artifacts</h1>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>This project explores how theatrical costumes can be understood as part of Italy‚Äôs cultural heritage using the ArCo knowledge graph and Large Language Models.</p>

<section id="methodology" style="padding: 2em; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>This project explores how theatrical costumes function as cultural heritage objects, using structured data from the ArCo Knowledge Graph and insights from large language models (LLMs). Our goal was to combine semantic technologies, human interpretation, and visual presentation to enrich and represent costume artifacts from Italian cinema and theatre.</p>

  <p>Each team member selected a specific costume or costume sketch and followed a shared methodology consisting of five main steps:</p>

  <h3>1. Object Selection via SPARQL</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Used the SPARQL endpoint of the ArCo Knowledge Graph</li>
    <li>Searched for cultural heritage objects using keywords</li>
    <li>Identified objects cataloged as Historic or Artistic Properties related to Italian theatre or cinema</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Object-Specific Analysis</h3>
  <p>Each participant selected one object and retrieved its metadata:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anna:</strong> Regina Isabella Costume Enrichment</li>
    <li><strong>Mariam:</strong> Theatrical Costume 1963 by Dario Fo</li>
    <li><strong>Arina:</strong> Arlecchino '600 sketch by Dario Fo</li>
    <li><strong>Anastasia:</strong> Theatrical Costume ‚ÄúLa Fama‚Äù</li>
    <li><strong>Daniil:</strong> "Second Accuser" by Dario Fo</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each participant noted what metadata was available (e.g., material, author) and what was missing (e.g., symbolic meaning, historical context).</p>

<h3>3. Contextual Enrichment with LLMs</h3>
<p>
  To bridge the gap between technical metadata and cultural meaning, participants used different language models: 
  <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank"><strong>ChatGPT</strong></a>, 
  <a href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Gemini</strong></a>, and 
  <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3" target="_blank"><strong>DeepSeek-V3</strong></a>.
</p>

  <h3>4. RDF Triple Generation</h3>
  <p>Using the ArCo ontology and newly enriched information, each member generated RDF triples describing material, technique, symbolism, or cultural references. These were saved in <code>.ttl</code> files and uploaded to GitHub.</p>

  <h3>5. HTML Publication and GitHub Integration</h3>
  <p>Each participant documented their contribution on a separate HTML page hosted via GitHub Pages. Each page includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A summary of the selected object</li>
    <li>SPARQL queries and results</li>
    <li>Prompts and LLM answers</li>
    <li>RDF triples</li>
    <li>A downloadable TTL file</li>
    <li>An image of the costume</li>
  </ul>
  <p>From the homepage, each name links to a dedicated page with this structured content.</p>

  <p>This methodology combines SPARQL-based data retrieval, AI-supported semantic enrichment, RDF modeling, and web publishing to build meaningful digital representations of theatrical costumes. The result is a project that merges cultural heritage and technology to bring Italy‚Äôs performance history into the linked data space.</p>

<h2 id="anna">Anna ‚Äì Regina Isabella Costume Analysis</h2>

<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>
My contribution focused on analyzing the theatrical costume <strong>‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù</strong>, created in 1992 by <strong>Dario Fo</strong> and <strong>Miguel Carbonell</strong>. This costume is cataloged in the ArCo Knowledge Graph as a <em>Historic or Artistic Property</em>.
</p>

<img src="regina-isabella.png" alt="Costume sketch of Regina Isabella" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px 0;">

<h3>SPARQL Analysis</h3>
<p>
Using SPARQL, I explored the ArCo endpoint and retrieved the properties of the object 
<a href="https://w3id.org/arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0500704575" target="_blank">0500704575</a>. I found that the object already includes metadata such as title, authorship, and description. However, it lacked symbolic, material, and contextual information.
</p>

<h3>LLM Prompting Techniques</h3>

<h4>1. Zero-shot Prompt</h4>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What does the theatrical costume ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù represent in terms of cultural or symbolic meaning?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It represents royal authority, feminine power, and Renaissance nobility, reflecting the image of a queen from the 16th century.</p>

<h4>2. Few-shot Prompt</h4>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<p>Example 1: Napoleon Bonaparte ‚Äî Symbolizes power and nationalism.<br>
Example 2: Cleopatra ‚Äî Represents feminine authority and exoticism.<br>
Now describe ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Regina Isabella symbolizes dignity, regal presence, and traditional Italian theatrical depictions of female power and historical prestige.</p>

<h4>3. Chain-of-thought Prompt</h4>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>What historical context does the name ‚ÄúRegina Isabella‚Äù refer to?</li>
  <li>What do the materials ‚Äî red velvet and gold embroidery ‚Äî traditionally symbolize?</li>
  <li>How are queens typically portrayed in Italian theater and cultural heritage?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Based on this reasoning, what does the costume most likely represent?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The name refers to a Renaissance queen, evoking images of female monarchy and historical authority. Red velvet and gold embroidery symbolize luxury, power, and theatrical grandeur. Queens in Italian culture are often portrayed as dignified, commanding, and elegant. Therefore, the costume most likely represents royal status, feminine strength, and the cultural ideal of noble womanhood on stage.</p>

<p><strong> üî∂ Zero-shot prompt:</strong> Which theater production or film featured a costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963?
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963, was designed for his play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man). This comedy, written by Dario Fo and Franca Rame, premiered in 1963. The costumes for this production were inspired by the 16th century setting of the play. The drawings, including the "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)," were used for the costume department and actors during the creation of the theatrical pieces. The play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" was later adapted for television by RAI TV in 1977 as part of the series "Il teatro di Dario Fo."

</p>

<p><strong> üî∂ Chain-of-thought prompt:</strong> Let's examine the origin of the costume step-by-step. It is based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963. Dario Fo was an influential Italian playwright and costume designer. Considering the year and his theatrical work, what performance might have featured this costume? Could it have been used in one of his satirical plays or a specific production from that period? Explain how you came up with answers step-by-step.
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Let's examine the likely origin of the costume by Dario Fo from 1963, considering his body of work and the theatrical context.

Step 1: Identify Key Information and Constraints

Artist/Designer: Dario Fo
Item: "Figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" (Costume sketches for the stage, female - drawing)
Date: 1963
Artist's Style/Work: Influential Italian playwright, satirist, and costume designer. Known for his politically charged, satirical plays, often drawing on commedia dell'arte and popular theatre traditions.
Step 2: Research Dario Fo's Major Works in or around 1963

This is the most crucial step. To pinpoint a potential production, we need to look at what plays Dario Fo was writing, directing, and performing in during that specific year or the immediate surrounding years.

Initial Search Strategy: My primary strategy here would be to search for "Dario Fo plays 1963," "Dario Fo theatrical productions 1963," or "Dario Fo's work in the early 1960s."

Key Findings (from a quick mental check or actual search if needed):

By 1963, Dario Fo and Franca Rame were well-established and had founded their own theatrical company, "Compagnia Dario Fo‚ÄìFranca Rame."
The early to mid-1960s were a highly prolific period for Fo.
A significant play from this period is Settimo: ruba un po' meno (Seventh: Steal a Little Less), which premiered in 1964. While the sketch is from 1963, design work often precedes a premiere.
Another relevant play is Rame and Fo's Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe (Isabella, Three Caravels and a Charlatan), which premiered in 1963. This is a strong candidate given the exact year.
His work around this time also included Chi ruba un piede √® fortunato in amore (He Who Steals a Foot is Lucky in Love), which premiered in 1961.
Step 3: Analyze Potential Matches Based on Themes and Style

Now, let's consider the nature of these plays in relation to costume design. Dario Fo's costumes were almost always integral to the satirical and often anachronistic nature of his plays.

Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe (1963):

Plot: This play is a satirical take on the discovery of America, particularly focusing on Christopher Columbus (the "charlatan") and Queen Isabella. It uses historical figures to comment on contemporary issues.
Costume Relevance: The historical setting (late 15th century) combined with Fo's satirical approach would necessitate costumes that reference historical periods but are likely exaggerated, simplified, or even anachronistic for comedic and critical effect. Female characters would include Queen Isabella, possibly court ladies, or women encountered in the New World. This play is a very strong contender.
Settimo: ruba un po' meno (1964):

Plot: This play deals with social justice, corruption, and the struggles of ordinary people, often with elements of farce and a contemporary setting, though it could incorporate historical or allegorical elements.
Costume Relevance: While slightly after 1963, costume design often begins a year or more in advance. The themes of social critique could involve various character types, including women from different social strata, potentially with elements of caricature in their attire.
Chi ruba un piede √® fortunato in amore (1961):

Plot: A farce about a man who fakes an injury to avoid work, leading to various chaotic situations.
Costume Relevance: While a possibility, the subject matter might lend itself less to elaborate "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili" that might evoke historical styles, compared to Isabella. Costumes here would likely be more everyday or farcical.
Step 4: Formulate the Most Likely Answer

Given the precise year (1963) and the nature of Fo's historical-satirical works, Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe stands out as the most probable production for which these "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili" were created.

Explanation: The play directly engages with a historical period (the late 15th century) through a satirical lens. This would have required costumes for female characters that could be either historically suggestive or deliberately anachronistic/exaggerated for comedic and critical effect, perfectly aligning with Fo's style and the typical needs of his productions. Designing for a major production like this in 1963, for a premiere in the same year, is perfectly plausible.
Conclusion:

The costume sketch "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo from 1963 most likely featured in the performance of his satirical play Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe, which premiered in 1963. This conclusion is reached by:

Identifying the exact year of the sketch.
Researching Dario Fo's major theatrical productions around that specific year.
Analyzing the themes and historical/satirical nature of those plays to determine which would most logically require "female stage costume sketches" that might reference historical styles for comedic or critical purposes, a hallmark of Fo's work.

<p><em> üü¢ Period and style of the cosutme üü¢ </em></p> 
<p><strong> üî∑ Zero-shot prompt:</strong> What historical clothing style is represented by a costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo, created in 1963?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Based on the context that the drawing series "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo was created in 1963 for his play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man), the costumes would have represented a 15th to early 16th-century historical clothing style, specifically influenced by the Spanish court and broader European fashion of that period.
Here's why:
Play's Setting: "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" is a satirical comedy that revolves around Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain. The historical events it parodies took place at the very end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century.
Dario Fo's Approach: While Dario Fo was known for his satirical and often anachronistic use of history to comment on contemporary society, his costumes for such plays would still be rooted in the historical period he was depicting. He would draw from actual historical clothing styles to create a recognizable base, which he would then manipulate, exaggerate, or simplify for comedic and political effect.
Specific Characteristics:
Female costumes of this era typically featured layered garments: an undergown (chemise), a fitted kirtle or gown, and often an overgown or robe.
Bodices could be tightly laced, and skirts were full, sometimes gathered or pleated.
Sleeves varied greatly, from fitted to large and elaborate, sometimes with slashes to reveal the lining or undergarment.
Headwear was crucial for women, ranging from simple veils and coifs to more elaborate headdresses like the hennin (though more common in the earlier 15th century) or the gabled hood and later French hoods. Spanish fashion, which would be particularly relevant for Queen Isabella, often featured more structured and formal headwear and elaborate brocades.
Fabrics would typically be rich for courtly figures, such as brocade, velvet, and silk, while commoners would wear wools and linens.
Therefore, the costume based on Dario Fo's 1963 drawing would have satirically or stylistically referenced the clothing of the Late Gothic to Early Renaissance period (circa 1480s-1520s), particularly as seen in Spain.

</p>
<p><strong> üî∑ Chain-of-thought prompt:</strong> Let‚Äôs analyze the style step-by-step. The costume is based on sketches titled "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo from 1963. Dario Fo often referenced historical styles in his satirical plays. What fashion period or historical clothing style might be reflected in this design? Consider typical theatrical costumes of the time and Fo‚Äôs influences. Explain how you came up with answers step-by-step.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Let's break down how to analyze the fashion period or historical clothing style reflected in Dario Fo's 1963 costume sketches, considering his influences and typical theatrical costumes of the time.

Step 1: Understand Dario Fo's Theatrical Style and Influences

Satirical and Political Theatre: Dario Fo was renowned for his satirical and politically charged plays. This often meant his works, and thus their costumes, would not be strictly historically accurate but rather exaggerated, symbolic, or even anachronistic to serve a comedic or critical purpose.
Commedia dell'Arte: A significant and well-documented influence on Dario Fo was the Commedia dell'Arte. This Italian theatrical tradition, which emerged in the 16th century, is characterized by:
Stock characters: Such as Arlecchino (Harlequin), Pantalone, Pulcinella, Brighella, Columbina, and Il Dottore.
Masks: Many of these characters wore distinctive masks.
Improvisation: Performances were often improvised around a loose scenario.
Exaggerated costumes: Costumes were designed to instantly identify the character and often featured bright colors, distinctive shapes, and sometimes exaggerated elements. These costumes were not always strictly historically accurate for the period they originated in, but evolved with the tradition.
Jesters and Raconteurs: Fo also drew inspiration from medieval jesters and traditional storytellers, who often employed elements of farce, physical comedy, and direct address to the audience. Their costumes, too, could be fantastical or symbolic rather than strictly period-specific.
"Unofficial Leftism" and Popular Culture: Fo's theatre was rooted in "unofficial leftism" and often aimed to connect with and critique contemporary society. This meant he might blend historical references with elements recognizable to a 1960s audience, or intentionally create costumes that felt "of the people" rather than elite or aristocratic.
Step 2: Consider Typical Theatrical Costumes of the 1960s

Not Necessarily Period-Accurate: In the 1960s, while some productions aimed for historical accuracy, theatrical costumes, especially in more experimental or satirical theatre like Fo's, often prioritized functionality, visual impact, and symbolic meaning over strict historical adherence.
Modern Interpretations: Designers might take historical elements and interpret them through a contemporary lens, or simplify them for ease of movement and quick changes.
Influence of Contemporary Fashion: While Fo was referencing historical styles, it's possible some subtle contemporary fashion sensibilities of 1963 (e.g., silhouette, choice of fabrics, general aesthetic of the time) might unconsciously or consciously seep into the designs, even if the primary inspiration is historical. However, given Fo's focus, direct 1960s fashion trends would likely be secondary to his historical theatrical inspirations.
Step 3: Analyze the "Figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" (Assuming we are looking at specific sketches)

Since I don't have the actual sketches to analyze, I will make an educated guess based on Fo's known influences. If I had the sketches, I would look for:

Silhouette: Is it voluminous, fitted, or exaggerated in certain areas?
Details: Are there ruffs, exaggerated collars, specific sleeve shapes (e.g., puffed, slashed), prominent lacing, distinct headwear, or specific types of footwear?
Fabric indication: Does the drawing suggest specific textures or drapes?
Character types: Do the costumes suggest archetypal characters (e.g., a flamboyant lover, a cunning servant, a foolish old man, a wise woman)?
Exaggeration/Caricature: Are there elements that are clearly not meant to be realistic but rather to convey a specific character trait or comedic effect?
Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude

Given Dario Fo's strong ties to Commedia dell'Arte and his use of historical references for satirical purposes, the most likely fashion period or historical clothing style reflected in his 1963 "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" would be:

1. Commedia dell'Arte / 16th-18th Century Italian Theatre Costumes (with a satirical twist): This is the strongest candidate. Fo frequently drew upon the archetypes and visual language of Commedia dell'Arte. Costumes in this tradition are often recognizable by their specific character associations (e.g., the elaborate dress of the Inamorata, the practical attire of Columbina, the more academic robes of Il Dottore, or the slightly absurd outfits of the Zanni). These wouldn't be strictly accurate 16th-18th century daily wear, but rather theatrical interpretations that evolved over centuries.

Explanation: Fo would likely adapt these traditional Commedia dell'Arte styles, possibly exaggerating certain features, simplifying others, or adding contemporary (for 1963) satirical elements to make them relevant to his social commentary. The fact that he was designing costumes for theatrical use further supports this, as theatrical costumes often have their own internal logic and tradition, distinct from strict historical fashion.
2. Broader Early Modern European (16th-18th Century) Influences, interpreted for comedy: Beyond just Commedia dell'Arte, Fo might have drawn from the general aesthetics of the 16th, 17th, or 18th centuries in Europe, particularly those periods known for more elaborate or distinctive silhouettes (e.g., ruffs, corsetry, voluminous skirts, specific hats). However, these would almost certainly be filtered through a comedic or satirical lens, rather than an attempt at historical accuracy.

In summary:

The fashion period most likely reflected in Dario Fo's 1963 costume sketches for "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" is Commedia dell'Arte, drawing from the established theatrical costume traditions of 16th-18th century Italian theatre, but reinterpreted with Fo's characteristic satirical exaggeration and symbolic intent. He would not be aiming for museum-level historical accuracy, but rather for costumes that instantly communicate character and contribute to the comedic and critical tone of his plays.

<p><strong> üî∑ Instruction-based prompt:</strong> You are a historian of theatrical costume design. Please analyze the clothing style of a costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo (1963). Indicate the historical era or stylistic movement it reflects (e.g., Renaissance, Baroque, 19th-century bourgeoisie, etc.). If the design is theatrical reinterpretation of a historical style, please mention that as well.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> As a historian of theatrical costume design, I can analyze the clothing style of a costume based on "figurini per costumi di scena, femminili (disegno)" by Dario Fo (1963) as a theatrical reinterpretation of the Late Gothic to Early Renaissance period, specifically the late 15th to early 16th century European fashion, with a distinct emphasis on Spanish court attire.
Here's a breakdown of the analysis:
Primary Historical Era: The core inspiration for the costume clearly originates from the Late 15th Century to Early 16th Century. This aligns precisely with the historical setting of Dario Fo's play "Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe" (1963), which satirizes the figures of Queen Isabella of Castile and Christopher Columbus. The fashion of this period, particularly in the Spanish court, was characterized by distinct silhouettes for women.
Key Characteristics of the Referenced Historical Style:
Silhouette: Women's fashion moved towards a more structured and imposing silhouette. Gowns often featured fitted bodices, sometimes with a pointed waistline, and very full, voluminous skirts.
Necklines: Square or wide, rounded necklines were common, often revealing the chemise beneath.
Sleeves: Varied widely, from close-fitting to extremely wide and sometimes slashed to reveal contrasting linings or undersleeves. The "bag sleeve" or "hanging sleeve" with an opening to allow the arm to pass through was also prevalent.
Headwear: Elaborate and often structured headwear was crucial, such as the gabled hood in England, or various forms of Spanish headdresses that could be stiffened and draped with veils, reflecting status and modesty.
Fabrics: Rich brocades, velvets, and silks were used for courtly dress, often in deep, vibrant colors, reflecting the opulence of the era.
Theatrical Reinterpretation by Dario Fo: It is crucial to emphasize that this is a theatrical reinterpretation rather than a precise historical reconstruction. Dario Fo, as a master of commedia dell'arte and political satire, would not have aimed for museum-level historical accuracy. Instead, his designs would have served several functions:
Immediate Recognition: The costume would need to be immediately recognizable by the audience as belonging to the specific historical period being satirized (i.e., Queen Isabella's era).
Exaggeration for Satire: Fo frequently employed exaggeration, caricature, and simplification in his costume designs to enhance comedic effect and underscore his critical commentary. Elements like sleeves, headwear, or the overall volume of the skirt might be slightly overblown or stylized for dramatic impact and comedic timing.
Functionality for Performance: The costumes needed to allow for the dynamic, often physical, performances characteristic of Fo's plays. This might involve practical considerations that diverge from strict historical accuracy, such as ease of movement or quick changes.
Aesthetic Cohesion with Set Design: The costume would also integrate with the overall visual aesthetic of the stage design, contributing to a cohesive theatrical world that was both historically evocative and boldly satirical.
In summary, the costume based on Dario Fo's 1963 "figurini" represents a theatrical reinterpretation of Late 15th-Early 16th Century European (specifically Spanish) court fashion, designed to visually anchor his satirical narrative while allowing for the expressive and often exaggerated performance style of his theatre.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This project demonstrates how knowledge graphs and language models can work together to enrich cultural heritage data. The costume is not only a visual artifact, but also a narrative element linked to Italian theater and political satire.By combining structured data from ArCo with insights generated through prompting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models</a>, we were able to uncover its theatrical origin, stylistic influences, and cultural significance.
In particular, this case highlights how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_Fo" target="_blank">Dario Fo's</a> figurini are not merely design sketches, but entry points into broader stories of performance, history, and ideology. The costume becomes a lens through which we can view not only a play, but an entire period of social commentary and artistic experimentation.</p>

    This costume is cataloged in the ArCo Knowledge Graph as a <em>Historic or Artistic Property</em>

  <p>
    The allegorical figure of Fame (<a href="https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview-arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0100408590-23.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>La Fama</em></a>) is deeply rooted in classical and Renaissance iconography
    and remains a recurring character in Italian visual and performing arts. The drawing, likely part of
    a theatrical set or costume collection, captures symbolic elements such as <strong>victory</strong> (laurel),
    <strong>power</strong> (eagle), and <strong>communication</strong> (caduceus), which are strongly associated with
    both theater and political representation.

<p><strong>Selected Model:</strong> Based on this comparison, <strong>GPT-4's Chain-of-Thought</strong> output was chosen for generating the RDF triples, due to its precise symbolic interpretation and cultural relevance.</p>

<h2>üß© RDF Enrichment</h2>

<p>Based on the Chain-of-Thought response by <strong>GPT-4</strong>, I enriched the ArCo resource <a href="https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview-arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0100408590-23.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">
  <code>0100408590‚Äì23</code>
</a> with additional symbolic and cultural semantics that were not present in the original metadata.</p>
<p>View the RDF enrichment file here: <a href="la-fama.ttl" target="_blank">üìÑ la-fama.ttl</a></p>

<p>This RDF enrichment integrates symbolic interpretation directly into the ArCo model using existing ontology classes such as <code>arco:hasSymbolicElement</code> and <code>arco:hasRepresentation</code>. Each element ‚Äî the laurel, eagle, and caduceus ‚Äî is individually described and linked to cultural concepts that were missing from the SPARQL-extracted data. This enhanced representation allows machines (and scholars) to better understand the <em>semantic depth</em> of the costume‚Äôs iconography.</p>

<h2>üèÅ Conclusion</h2>

<p>This project shows how symbolic artworks like <a href="https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview-arco/resource/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0100408590-23.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>La Fama</em></a> can benefit from semantic enrichment using large language models and RDF technologies. The original metadata described only physical and catalog data, but through <strong>prompting strategies and model comparison</strong>, I was able to reconstruct the cultural and iconographic meaning embedded in the drawing.</p>

<p>By integrating new triples into the ArCo ontology, this enrichment enhances both <strong>machine readability</strong> and <strong>cultural interpretation</strong>. This case highlights the potential of LLMs as tools for bridging gaps in heritage knowledge graphs, especially in the arts and humanities domain.</p>

<h1 id="danil">Danil ‚Äì Second Accuser Costume Analysis</h1>

  <h2>Topic</h2>
  <p>My contribution focused on analyzing the costume of the "Second Accuser" from Dario Fo's 1992 Valencian production of <em>Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe</em>. This study combines SPARQL queries of cultural heritage databases with Large Language Model (LLM) inferences to reconstruct the costume's design, materials, and historical influences.</p>

  <h2>SPARQL Analysis</h2>
  <p>Using SPARQL, I queried the ArCo endpoint to explore the metadata for theatrical costumes linked to Dario Fo:</p>
  
  <pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT ?cp 
WHERE {
  ?cp a arco:HistoricOrArtisticProperty ; 
      rdfs:label ?l .
  FILTER(REGEX(?l, "vestito|teatro|costume|Fo", "i"))
}
LIMIT 50</code></pre>

  <p>The retrieved information includes general records on Fo's theatrical costumes but no direct match for the 1992 Valencia production. Key gaps identified:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Missing performance link</strong> to the 1992 Valencia production</li>
    <li><strong>No details</strong> on fabric, color, or construction</li>
    <li><strong>Unclear historical/artistic parody references</strong></li>

  <p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Which Dario Fo play featured a 'Second Accuser' character in a 1992 Valencia production, and what was the costume's symbolic role?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The play is <em>Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe</em> (1992, Valencia), a satire of Columbus and the Spanish court. The 'Second Accuser' costume likely parodied Inquisition officials or corrupt nobles‚Äîexaggerated with tattered luxury (e.g., burlap dyed black/gold) to critique power and dogma.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Describe plausible materials, colors, and accessories for this costume, considering Fo's aesthetic.<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Materials: Cheap fabrics (burlap, linen) to mock opulence, with visible stitching. Colors: Black (authority/mystique) and gold (greed), deliberately garish. Accessories: Oversized rosary, giant quill, or a <em>commedia</em>-style hooked nose to emphasize hypocrisy.</p>

  <p><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> What historical/clothing styles did Fo distort for this character?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Fo blended:
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Inquisition robes</strong> (elongated sleeves, black/red)</li>
    <li><strong>Commedia's Il Dottore</strong> (scholarly pomp via oversized hat)</li>
    <li><strong>Renaissance doublets</strong> (distorted with asymmetrical patterns)</li>
  </ol>
  This fusion underscored the absurdity of dogmatic authority.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project demonstrates how knowledge graphs and language models can work together to enrich cultural heritage data. The "Second Accuser" costume is not merely a theatrical artifact, but a narrative device tied to Dario Fo's political satire and the tradition of <em>commedia dell'arte</em>. By combining structured data from ArCo with insights generated through prompting large language models, we uncovered its role in <em>Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe</em> (1992, Valencia), its materials (burlap, linen, exaggerated accessories), and its stylistic parody of Inquisition robes and Renaissance power dress.</p>
    <p>The costume becomes a lens through which we can view Fo's critique of dogma and colonialism‚Äîblending historical reference with grotesque theater. This case also underscores the challenges of documenting ephemeral stage designs and the value of LLMs in reconstructing lost context.</p>
